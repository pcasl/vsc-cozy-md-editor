# Cozy MD Editor — VS Code Extension

## What This Is
A VS Code extension that makes markdown feel like a real writing environment.
It layers editorial chrome (toolbar, table ops, frontmatter management),
CriticMarkup-based track changes, and Claude Code integration on top of the
native Monaco text editor — so writers never leave VS Code but never feel like
they're "coding" either.

## Who This Is For
Product managers (and similar non-developer knowledge workers) who are brand new
to VS Code, markdown, and Claude Code — all at once. Every UX decision should
assume the user has never seen a markdown file before and doesn't know what a
terminal is. Power-user features are fine, but the defaults must be
approachable.

## Collaboration Model
Track changes supports three modes, all stored as CriticMarkup in the file:
- **Solo editing** — one author reviewing their own drafts
- **Me + Claude** — Claude as a co-editor, changes attributed to "Claude"
- **Multi-author** — multiple human editors with author attribution

Claude's edits can appear either as CriticMarkup tracked changes (for review)
or as direct edits, toggled by the user via a setting / command. The default
is tracked, so nothing surprises a new user.

## Google Docs Sync — Current Scope
Google Docs round-trip is a key long-term differentiator, but the sync CLI
(`gws-cli`) is blocked. Current policy:
- **Do now (no-regrets):** Store the Google Doc URL in frontmatter so the
  pairing is always captured. Build the "Open in Docs" CodeLens. Use code-fence
  frontmatter delimiters (not `---`) so docs survive a Docs round-trip.
- **Defer:** Programmatic sync, three-way merge, status-bar indicators.
  These can wait until gws-cli unblocks.

## Build & Run
- Requires Node 20+ (`.nvmrc` provided — run `nvm use` if needed)
- `npm install` — install dependencies
- `npm run build` — production build via esbuild
- `npm run watch` — development build with watch mode
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint
- `npm run test` — run parser unit tests (mocha, TDD interface)
- `npm run test:integration` — run VS Code integration tests (requires Extension Development Host)
- `npm run package` — package as .vsix for distribution
- Press F5 in VS Code to launch Extension Development Host

## Process Rules

### Document Before Fixing
When an issue is reported or discovered, ALWAYS update this file (Known Issues,
roadmap, or phase scope) BEFORE writing any code to fix it. No battlefield
surgery — every issue gets a paper trail with root cause and proposed approach
before implementation begins. This applies even if the fix seems obvious.

### Parallelize With Agent Teams
Use agent teams to dispatch independent work in parallel whenever tasks touch
non-overlapping files. Only serialize when there are real dependencies.

### Keep Docs Current
Every agent working on this project must update CLAUDE.md if their work changes
the current state, introduces a known issue, or deviates from the documented
plan. The roadmap and Known Issues sections are living documents, not snapshots.

### Log Decisions
When a dependency is added or removed, a technical approach is chosen over an
alternative, or a PRD assumption is overridden by implementation reality — add
an entry to the Decision Log below. Future agents should check this log before
re-investigating settled questions. Include: what was decided, what was rejected,
and why.

## Decision Log
Decisions made during implementation that override or refine the original PRD.

- **Fork Marketplace identity** (2026-07-12): The fork is published as `rime.cozy-critic-md` rather than overwriting the original `dudgeon.cozy-md-editor` listing. README Marketplace links target the fork while preserving attribution to the original publisher.
- **Hand-written parsers over markdown-it** (Phase 1): The PRD specified
  `markdown-it` for table boundary detection. Implementation used hand-written
  regex parsers for tables, CriticMarkup, and frontmatter instead. Reason:
  hand-written parsers handle serialization, alignment preservation, and line-
  number tracking directly — markdown-it would require AST transformation.
  `markdown-it` dependency removed as dead weight.
- **Snapshot+Diff over real-time wrapping for track changes** (Phase 3 planning):
  Real-time `onDidChangeTextDocument` wrapping was rejected because VS Code's
  `undoStopBefore/After` has been broken since 2017 (Issue #38535), causing
  Cmd+Z to require two presses. Snapshot+Diff approach: snapshot on toggle-on,
  `diffWords()` on commit, single `editor.edit()` for CriticMarkup generation.
  Undo works perfectly. ~100 lines vs ~400 lines. Every comparable tool (VS
  Code Git SCM, GitLens, Overleaf, Scrivener) uses snapshot+diff.
- **Cmd+Alt+M for comments** (Phase 3 planning): PRD declared both
  `addComment` (Cmd+Alt+C) and `addCriticComment` (Cmd+Alt+M). Consolidated
  to a single command on Cmd+Alt+M per user preference.
- **CodeLens for controls, not styled badges** (Phase 2): CodeLens API does
  not support custom colors/backgrounds. Using unicode prefixes (✓/✗/▦) and
  bracket wrappers as visual anchors. Inline styled badges via `after` pseudo-
  element decorations are a Phase 6 upgrade path.
- **Blockquote markers dimmed, not hidden** (Phase 1.5): `letterSpacing: '-1em'`
  for hiding characters causes column misalignment on soft-wrapped lines.
  Blockquote `> ` markers use opacity dimming instead. Short inline markers
  (bold `**`, backticks) are safe to hide since they don't soft-wrap.
- **`border-left` via textDecoration is not viable** (Phase 1.6): Renders as
  literal pipe `|` characters. Blockquote visual treatment uses italic +
  subtle backgroundColor instead.

## Technical Decisions
- TypeScript, esbuild bundler, VS Code Extension API
- All features operate on the NATIVE text editor — no custom webview editors
- CriticMarkup is the storage format for all track changes and comments
- Frontmatter uses code fence delimiters (```), NOT triple-dash (---)
  because --- renders as a horizontal rule in Google Docs, breaking round-trip
- Frontmatter parser must READ both formats (compatibility) but WRITE code fences only
- Use `yaml` npm package for frontmatter parsing (preserves comments)
- CriticMarkup parser is hand-written regex (no npm library exists)
- Table parser is hand-written (not using markdown-it — the PRD originally
  planned to use markdown-it for table detection, but hand-written parsing
  proved simpler and better suited for serialization/alignment needs)
- All decorations use `editor.setDecorations` with `DecorationRenderOptions`
- Claude Code dispatch uses `vscode.window.createTerminal` + `sendText`
- Google Docs/Sheets pairing uses frontmatter URL fields, not a sidecar database

```

## Code Style
- One module per feature area (see architecture above)
- All parsers have dedicated unit tests
- Commands are registered in extension.ts, implementations in commands/
- Decoration providers are in decorations/, managed by decorations/manager.ts
- Use VS Code's built-in test runner (`@vscode/test-electron`)

## CriticMarkup Spec Reference
- Addition: {++ added text ++}
- Deletion: {-- deleted text --}
- Substitution: {~~ old text ~> new text ~~}
- Comment: {>> comment text <<}
- Highlight: {== highlighted text ==}{>> optional comment <<}
- Full spec: https://criticmarkup.com/spec.php

## Key Constraints
- NEVER replace the native text editor with a webview/custom editor
- NEVER hold document state outside the file — the file on disk is truth
- NEVER write frontmatter with --- delimiters — always use code fences (```)
- All syntax markers (bold, italic, links, headings, CriticMarkup) follow the
  expand-on-cursor pattern: hidden/dimmed when cursor is away, fully visible
  when cursor enters the element. This is the core UX — it must be flicker-free.
- The decoration manager uses paired DecorationType sets (collapsed + expanded)
  swapped on cursor move, NOT full decoration array rebuilds
- All toolbar buttons must be scoped to `resourceLangId == markdown`
- Track changes recording must handle: paste, undo/redo, multi-cursor,
  editing inside existing CriticMarkup blocks
- Claude Code integration must degrade gracefully when Claude is not installed
- Table operations must preserve column alignment markers
- Google Docs pairing is stored in frontmatter fields, not external config
- Google sync features must degrade gracefully when CLI is unavailable

## VS Code API Limitations (learned the hard way)
These are things we tried that DON'T WORK in the VS Code extension API:
- **`fontSize` in DecorationRenderOptions** — not a supported property.
  Workaround: CSS injection via `textDecoration: 'none; font-size: 1.6em'`
  (works for font-size, validated in F5).
- **`border-left` via textDecoration injection** — renders as literal pipe `|`
  characters instead of a CSS border. NOT VIABLE.
- **`padding-left` via textDecoration injection** — same issue, not viable.
- **`letterSpacing: '-1em'` for hiding characters** — works on single lines but
  causes misaligned columns when text soft-wraps. Safe for short inline markers
  (bold `**`, link brackets), NOT safe for blockquote `> ` markers on long lines.
- **CodeLens custom styling** — CodeLens API has no support for colors,
  backgrounds, or fonts. Titles are plain text in VS Code's built-in style.
  Unicode prefixes (✓, ✗, ▦) and bracket wrappers are the only visual options.
- **Per-language color customizations** — `workbench.colorCustomizations`
  cannot be scoped per language. Line number dimming affects all file types.
  Per-theme customization (`[Default Dark Modern]` etc.) works but is verbose.

## Testing
- `npm test` runs parser unit tests via mocha (TDD interface, `suite`/`test`)
  - Scoped to `src/test/suite/parsers/**/*.test.ts` (no vscode dependency)
  - Run `npm test` for current pass/fail count
- `npm run test:integration` runs VS Code integration tests via Extension
  Development Host (`src/test/suite/extension.test.ts`)
- Unit tests target: CriticMarkup parser, table parser/serializer,
  frontmatter parser (both delimiter formats)
- Integration tests target: decoration rendering, expand-on-cursor transitions,
  command execution, accept/reject operations (most not yet written)
- Performance test: expand-on-cursor must complete decoration swap in <16ms
  (one frame) on a 500-line document with 50+ decorated elements

## Skills
The `.claude/skills/` directory contains Claude Code skills for this project:
- `.claude/skills/build/` — `/build` slash command. Runs the full build → lint → test →
  package pipeline and reports pass/fail with actionable summaries.
- `.claude/skills/release/` — `/release` slash command. End-to-end release pipeline:
  pre-flight checks → changelog/README updates → build validation → marketplace
  publish → git tag & push. Uses AskUserQuestion at key decision points
  (cut release?, version bump type, final publish confirmation).
- `.claude/skills/skill-creator/` — Meta-skill for creating, evaluating, and iterating
  on new skills.

## Known Issues / Current Work
- **Comment command does not highlight selected text** (2026-07-08):
  `cozyMd.addCriticComment` currently wraps selected text as a standalone
  CriticMarkup comment (`{>>selected<<}`), which treats the selected prose as
  comment text instead of preserving/highlighting the prose. Proposed approach:
  when text is selected, emit CriticMarkup highlight-with-comment syntax
  (`{==selected==}{>>  <<}`) and place the cursor inside the new comment.

- **Track-change replacements should render as separate delete/add marks** (2026-07-09):
  `generateCriticMarkup()` currently collapses adjacent `diffWords()` remove+add
  pairs into CriticMarkup substitution syntax (`{~~old~>new~~}`). User requested
  simpler replacement output as an explicit deletion followed by an addition.
  Proposed approach: remove the substitution-pair special case and emit every
  removed segment as `{-- --}` and every added segment as `{++ ++}`.

- **Track-change replacement hunks should group deletions before additions** (2026-07-09):
  After switching away from substitution syntax, complex replacement hunks can
  interleave `{-- --}` and `{++ ++}` segments based on `diffWords()` output.
  User requested added words appear after all removed words and before the next
  unchanged text. Proposed approach: process each contiguous changed hunk as a
  group, concatenate removed segments first, then concatenate added segments.

- **Track-change replacement hunks should absorb whitespace-only separators** (2026-07-09):
  `diffWords()` can report spaces between replaced words as unchanged, which
  splits phrase-level replacements into per-word delete/add pairs such as
  `{--a--}{++d++} {--b--}{++e++}`. User requested phrase-level output, e.g.
  `{--a b c--}{++d e f++}`. Proposed approach: when a changed hunk is followed
  by whitespace-only unchanged text and then another change, treat that
  whitespace as part of the same replacement hunk for both removed and added
  sides. Stop grouping before the next non-whitespace unchanged text.


- **Add Clean display mode for track changes** (2026-07-09):
  Current editor chrome has two display modes: Cozy (decorated markdown) and MD
  (raw markdown). User requested a third `Clean` mode where additions render like
  Cozy mode, but CriticMarkup comments and deletions collapse to icons instead
  of showing their text content. Proposed approach: extend the decoration manager
  from a boolean enabled/disabled state to a `cozy` / `clean` / `md` display
  mode, keep raw MD as decoration-off, and register Clean-specific CriticMarkup
  providers for comment/deletion content that hide text while showing icons.


- **Display mode toolbar button labels should reflect the current mode** (2026-07-09):
  After adding the three-mode cycle, the editor-title button label shows the
  destination command (`Clean`, `MD`, `Cozy`) instead of the current display mode.
  User expects the circular button label to update according to the active mode.
  Proposed approach: keep the same command cycle (`cozy -> clean -> md -> cozy`)
  but set the visible command titles to the current mode for each `when` state.


- **Swap macOS shortcuts for track changes and table menu** (2026-07-09):
  Current keybindings use Cmd+Shift+T for track changes and Cmd+Opt+T for the
  table menu. User requested Cmd+Opt+T for toggling track changes and
  Cmd+Shift+T for opening the table menu. Proposed approach: update the macOS
  keybindings in `package.json` while leaving command IDs unchanged.


- **Markdown word autocomplete should be enabled by default** (2026-07-09):
  VS Code often does not auto-popup word suggestions in Markdown prose, and this
  extension does not yet ship a custom completion provider. User requested word
  autocomplete to work automatically. Proposed approach: add Markdown-scoped
  `configurationDefaults` for `editor.quickSuggestions` and
  `editor.wordBasedSuggestions` so VS Code's built-in word suggestions appear
  while writing Markdown.


- **Markdown autocomplete should prefer Copilot, not coding-style word suggest** (2026-07-09):
  The previous Markdown autocomplete default enabled VS Code quick suggestions and
  word-based suggestions, which feels like coding autocomplete in prose. User
  clarified they want VS Code Copilot inline autocomplete instead. Proposed
  approach: remove Markdown quick/word suggestion defaults, keep inline suggest
  enabled for Markdown, and add a Copilot Markdown enablement default that is
  harmless when Copilot is not installed.


- **Remove Cozy Tab keybindings to preserve native VS Code/Copilot behavior** (2026-07-09):
  Cozy MD binds Tab and Shift+Tab in Markdown for table/list navigation, which can
  block native VS Code behavior such as accepting Copilot inline suggestions. User
  requested removing Cozy's Tab shortcut so native VS Code shortcuts work.
  Proposed approach: remove the contributed Tab and Shift+Tab keybindings from
  `package.json` while keeping the underlying commands available for future UI or
  command-palette use.
